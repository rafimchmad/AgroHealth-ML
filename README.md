## Dataset
At first, we found [PlantVillage](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset) dataset. Later, we found [New Plant Diseases Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset) dataset which contains additional images from the previous dataset. **New Plant Diseases Dataset** consists of about 87K RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves. This dataset is categorized into 38 different classes which is a combination of the name of the plant and its disease in folders. Total number of diseases recorded are 21 different diseases. The total dataset is divided into **training** and **validation** folder which maintain the directory structure. Another directory named **test** containing 33 images for model testing purposes.

## The Models and Result
We made two types of models, using convolutional neural networks from scratch and using transfer learning with additional layers. For the result, click [here](https://github.com/nekoniiiii/AgroHealth-ML/tree/main/Result).
